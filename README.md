## 📋 Overview

This project demonstrates:
- OpenCanary honeypot deployment on Raspberry Pi
- FTP brute-force and HTTP flood attack simulation
- Real-time Discord webhook alerts for detected attacks
- Complete attack detection and notification pipeline

## 📁 Project Files

- `ftpbruteforce.py` - Simulates FTP brute force attacks
- `httpflood.py` - Simulates HTTP flood attacks
- `opencanary.conf` - Honeypot configuration 

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Raspberry Pi** runs OpenCanary honeypot with FTP and HTTP services
2. **Attack scripts** (from laptop) generate malicious traffic via ethernet connection
3. **OpenCanary** detects the attacks and logs them
4. **Discord webhook** sends real-time alerts to Discord server
